<p>The garden gave its way. I found a voicemail from you the other day. Nothing about it surprised me; I still remembered and will always remember your voice.
My old love, you are no longer a tangible thing I can touch, hug, or poke. So it goes. This is what it means for a life to end.</p>

<p>Did you feel the earthquake last night? How do you introduce yourself? What were your friends like in childhood? Did you play soccer then? Were your brothers mean? How about now? Are they more tender, soft, mature to you in adulthood? Or are you still the baby, easily pushed and fiercely protected? What language do you speak to your mother? When is the last time you went to the beach? Do you shower in the mornings or evenings?</p>

<p>Every since I started recording music, I’ve been more alert to sound or fuzz. To the different qualities of reverb in stairwells and open rooms. I dated someone on the floor above me last year. I would convince them to take the stairs to see me instead of the elevator, and when it ended, I would still steal away to that stairwell to sing, meekly hoping that they wouldn’t walk down those stairs and that they would at the same time.</p>

<p>A functioning mess of a bookstore in Portland, Oregon. Run by several loyal staff, the woman on shift demonstrated a near encyclopedic knowledge of where each book was. There must have been 10,000 books lining those walls, falling over, sometimes buried under each other. Many books didn’t even get shelf space, because there wasn’t enough, so they remained stacked on the floor. But she knew where everything was.</p>

<p>My dance teacher from fall quarter – the one thing I can remember is her smell. Like grain. Sacks of rice and flour. And her shoes, which are worn but durable, rubber soled and black.</p>

<p>Taking three hours to cook fava beans, providing a guitar and a voice (“pissing in a river”), writing my friends’ names on her hands to remember them. Ariana told us about how she used to go for long barefoot runs in this wilderness, with no food or water to avoid making noise and scaring the animals. Apricots to initiate a friendship, popcorn from the cob, roasted Gaga Dabs, nettle tea from nettle collected that day.</p>

<p>I whisper to my sleeping friends on the I-5. Once again I return to marshes, fields, and wind that I am familiar with. Maybe someday I’ll produce writing that references where I grew up. Then, perhaps, nobody will want to read it; just as I was reading Frank O’Hara’s poem of lists &amp; realizing that nobody wants to read lists.</p>

<p>When I wake up, there is oftentimes a recognizable image pressed onto the front of my mind. An imprint of the dream I was having. Barely traceable, square around the edges, stored in a picture frame, behind glass. Faintly colored, actively fading away, and frustratingly familiar. What it becomes, then, is something subconscious.
These visitors to my life become recurring dreams. They have conversations with my subconscious without me present. They influence my motion, my self-respect, my desires, and my sense of adventure.
I’ve answered my own question.</p>
