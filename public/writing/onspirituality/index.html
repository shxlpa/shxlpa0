<p>I went to DC last week to visit some family and was invited to go to a Buddhist temple with a UCLA friend who hails from Maryland. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but what I received was indescribable. I can’t say I’m not spiritual, because I definitely do become a bit spiritual sometimes (and especially when I’m desperate). But this – this was the first time I felt spiritual within a surrounding period of contentment and happiness. Normally, I can attribute my happiness to some achievement or action of my own, and my spirituality to a deficit of something in my life. I’ll find that I’m content on days when I’ve taken the time to breathe and make tea in the morning. I’m spiritual when something needs to be fixed and I have no answers myself. That I’m happy when I’ve been working out consistently and feeding my body well. That I feel whole when I’ve made enough art recently and have balanced the terrible nonsense of engineering with the beautiful reprieve of creating.</p>
<p>I showed up to this temple, however, in a menial, humbled state – not really thinking about anything and not expecting much. Nothing bad, nothing good. From my ground state of 0, this temple was able to conjure feelings and emotions in myself that could not have been previously rooted in anything else.</p>
<p>In a nebulous way, perhaps I’ve just defined my own version of spirituality – the ability of something, someone, or myself to command feelings in me that seemingly have no other explainable root cause. The origin feels like magic.</p>

  Forget everything else. Imagine you are me for a second.

<p>Off the side of an unassuming road without sidewalks – not unlike Bel Air, if you were to replace the gates with walls of lush East Coast trees – a dirt path suddenly opens up, lined with tiny shrines, prayer flags, and solar-powered lamps. You drive down the gravel, hoping you won’t put a flat in the rental car. You park; you wait. Your friend is late, so you get out to explore and are immediately assaulted by thick air, which pulls sweat from your pores without permission. You find a soccer ball on a field of weeds, not grass (interestingly, you have not seen one manicured lawn here) and get a pulse on your juggling count. It’s still 5, which is right where you left off after you quit the local soccer team in 6th grade.</p>
<p>Imagine walking through fields of flies, but they do not harm you – you’re suffering together in the soup of air, after all. And everything put together – the 10 am humidity, the impossible height of the tree cover, the weed field, the flies – gives your vision a sweet and orange glow.</p>
<p>In Sikhism, when you go to the Gurdwara, the worship happens inside. Here, the main building next to the gravel lot appears padlocked. No entry allowed. What’s the deal? It doesn’t look like there’s anything else on the property. Did you drive 45 minutes for nothing?</p>
<p>Your friend appears suddenly, and whisks you away – down the gravel driveway, across the road, into the thicket of trees on the other side. A dirt pathway appears, and opens up to reveal the largest statue of Buddha you’ve witnessed in the United States.</p>
<p>Through the brambles, pathways begin to reveal themselves on either side of the stupa. Conjuring themselves up after a pause. It’s as if you had to prove yourself first; silently, stubbornly, waiting for the forest to show itself to you without demanding that it hurry.</p>
<p>You choose the left path.
The forest seems to be caught in a limbo; forever trapped between the small and large.
In its tiny moments, you pass alone on a thin pathway, stampeding into cobwebs and greeting the little lifeforms that were there before you &amp; will be there after you.</p>
<p>In its vast moments, the forest feels cosmic, its web of pathways opening up to reveal another human imprint. Another stupa fuzzes into view.</p>
<p>You suddenly feel comforted. There is relief in knowing that another person has been there before you. No longer are you the lone explorer of a universe – you are, once again, from the family of things.</p>
<p><em>This place</em> – there’s something about the morning here. Yes, it’s comforting to know that another human had been there, but you are also relieved that you don’t know who. It almost feels as if spirits collude each night to move these stone imprints around the forest, after the last human feet have left.</p>
<p>It feels dangerous, too. As if all you were ever meant for is to lay here and sleep.
What good is the training of university if this is all there is?</p>
