<p>I don’t know why my first thought is always about how I could subvert the current state of things. Part of it must attribute to my profession – my propensity to flick through all possible options before settling on one.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just telling myself that to convince myself that I’m not a bad person.</p>
<p>But I also think a huge part of it is just how my brain works.</p>
<p>I pass inordinate amounts of time thinking about things like how I would escape from a prison when I drive by jail complexes. I also think about valid situations, like how I would get to safety if there’s a sketchy guy near me. But that too, there’s me thinking up how I would sneak in a carry on bag over the size limit, how I would hop the security fence to go explore the blinking red windmill field off Hwy 14, and how I would get away with camping somewhere I want to go without permits.</p>
<p>And when I find real life loopholes, like the upper security checkpoint at LAX that’s always empty, it makes me incredibly happy. I feel like I’ve solved one more problem in the universe. In the search to understand the order of things, I’ve found one more elegant solution.</p>
<p>Human structures, innate empathy, organizations and infrastructures are all probabilistic processes at the end of the day.</p>
<p>There’s a reason Coldplay can harvest 1/5th of their concerts’ power from the vibration of the stadium – because human behavior is predictable. They know people will dance, shout, cheer, and stomp.</p>
<p>So when you find a loophole in the world, it’s like when two out of phase beats sync up to create a beautiful rhythm for a brief moment in time.</p>
<p>All of these processes, existing on their own path within the individual brains of everyone around you, create structures, behaviors, beliefs &amp; countries that are often at odds with one another. But sometimes, just for a minute or two, they sync flawlessly, and a loophole opens up. Suddenly you’ve made it through airport security in less than 5 minutes. Suddenly, your flight has been upgraded or your overweight luggage overlooked, you remember an old friend in a foreign country with a place to stay, or you look around the car on a road trip and realize the most perfect incidental crew has gathered to adventure.</p>
<p>So maybe there is merit to wondering if I can escape a prison. I’m curious if the world can work in ways that are not obvious. I want to live inside all the loopholes and enjoy the discovery.</p>
<p>We look to each other in these moments and exclaim, “Wow, we got lucky!” In reality these are just the natural &amp; mathematical orders of our world lining up in time. Just for you. Celebrate it.</p>
