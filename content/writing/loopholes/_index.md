I don’t know why my first thought is always about how I could subvert the current state of things. Part of it must attribute to my profession – my propensity to flick through all possible options before settling on one.

Maybe I’m just telling myself that to convince myself that I’m not a bad person. 

But I also think a huge part of it is just how my brain works. 

I pass inordinate amounts of time thinking about things like how I would escape from a prison when I drive by jail complexes. I also think about valid situations, like how I would get to safety if there’s a sketchy guy near me. But that too, there’s me thinking up how I would sneak in a carry on bag over the size limit, how I would hop the security fence to go explore the blinking red windmill field off Hwy 14, and how I would get away with camping somewhere I want to go without permits. 

And when I find real life loopholes, like the upper security checkpoint at LAX that’s always empty, it makes me incredibly happy. I feel like I’ve solved one more problem in the universe. In the search to understand the order of things, I’ve found one more elegant solution. 

Human structures, innate empathy, organizations and infrastructures are all probabilistic processes at the end of the day. 

There’s a reason Coldplay can harvest 1/5th of their concerts’ power from the vibration of the stadium – because human behavior is predictable. They know people will dance, shout, cheer, and stomp. 

So when you find a loophole in the world, it’s like when two out of phase beats sync up to create a beautiful rhythm for a brief moment in time. 

All of these processes, existing on their own path within the individual brains of everyone around you, create structures, behaviors, beliefs & countries that are often at odds with one another. But sometimes, just for a minute or two, they sync flawlessly, and a loophole opens up. Suddenly you’ve made it through airport security in less than 5 minutes. Suddenly, your flight has been upgraded or your overweight luggage overlooked, you remember an old friend in a foreign country with a place to stay, or you look around the car on a road trip and realize the most perfect incidental crew has gathered to adventure. 

So maybe there is merit to wondering if I can escape a prison. I’m curious if the world can work in ways that are not obvious. I want to live inside all the loopholes and enjoy the discovery.

We look to each other in these moments and exclaim, “Wow, we got lucky!” In reality these are just the natural & mathematical orders of our world lining up in time. Just for you. Celebrate it.
