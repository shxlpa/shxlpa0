### Wide base ceramics 

![Alt text](/images/pottery.jpg) <br><br>

I designed a line of ceramics for a slow, intentional pourover coffee routine. I threw wide base pieces in Obsidian clay, a temperamental but beautiful clay body. I drew a pomegrenate design in procreate, designed a stamp around it in OnShape, and printed it in PLA. My grandmother's name, "Nispal", means pomegrenate - she would always scrape her name into her dishware.
