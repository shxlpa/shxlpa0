# Software Engineering Internship @ Vena Vitals
In 2022 I joined an 8 person startup (Vena Vitals) for an internship focused on non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring. My coursework has spanned bioinformatics, bionics, and the decoding of Utah array neural signals. One of my biggest fascinations in college has been developing non-invasive imaging techniques for the healthcare industry. 

At Vena Vitals, I worked on a team of R&D engineers to conduct human sensor tests in the operating room and write algorithms identifying physiological features. My algorithms detected two important blood pressure events in the sensor capacitance data, the systolic peak and dicrotic notch. 

Identifying these features was a crucial step for developing a robust mapping between the raw sensor output and corresponding ground truth blood pressure readings. This laid the groundwork for future machine learning inference.

I also conducted tests and recorded data in the operating room, observing clinical conventions and conducting clinical studies for FDA approval.
